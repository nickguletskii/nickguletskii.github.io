		<h4><a href="http://nickguletskii.github.io/GLXOSD/">GLXOSD</a></h4>
		GLXOSD is an OSD/overlay for OpenGL applications running under Linux.
		<h4><a href="https://github.com/TSLK">TSLK</a></h4>
		TSLK is an unfinished rewrite of my old project. It is a small educational language that was built to be translatable. Unfortunately, I haven't finished the translation part. I might revisit this project later, without the foolish overly test-driven development.
